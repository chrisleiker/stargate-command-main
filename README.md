# Stargate Command

An app launcher for Windows that dials your programs like the SG-1 gate.

Type a program name, press Enter, and the gate dials it. The ring spins, seven
chevrons lock one at a time, the kawoosh fires, and your program opens.

It is slower than clicking an icon. That is the point.

## Download

Grab the installer from [Releases](../../releases/latest), run it, done.
Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit. Nothing else to install.

It is not code-signed, so Windows will show a blue "Windows protected your PC"
box. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. A signing certificate costs a few
hundred dollars a year and this is a hobby project. If you would rather not
trust a stranger's binary, the source is right here and builds in two commands.

## Using it

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| *type* | filter your programs |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | dial it, about 10 seconds |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | dial the full 28-second version |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | change speed, including an instant one |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | abort the dial, clear the search, or hide the window |
| <kbd>I</kbd> | open or close the iris |
| <kbd>M</kbd> | audio on or off |
| <kbd>F5</kbd> | rescan for new programs |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> | summon it from anywhere, rebindable |

Press **MANAGE** to hide entries you never launch, **+ ADD** for anything the
Start Menu misses: a program, a document, a folder, or a web link.

## The details I got carried away on

**Every program has its own address.** The name is hashed into six
constellations plus the Point of Origin, so it never changes. Photoshop is
always Canis Minor, Perseus, Pisces, Capricornus, Lynx, Sculptor.

**All 39 glyphs are the real ones**, traced from reference artwork rather than
drawn by hand, so the symbols on the ring are the actual constellations.

**The chevrons light in the right order.** They are not evenly spaced: 1, 2, 3
down the right, 4, 5, 6 back up the left, 7 at the top. Each symbol spins to
top dead center to be grabbed, exactly as on screen.

**The iris works.** It is a real leaf shutter, 22 blades, and the spiral falls
out of the geometry rather than being drawn on.

Close it and the gate still dials perfectly, but nothing comes through and your
program does not open. That is not a bug.

## Build it yourself

```bash
npm install
npm start          # run it
npm run dist       # build the installer
```

Needs Node and Windows. There are no runtime dependencies beyond Electron
itself: the glyphs, the sounds and the PNG decoding are all hand-rolled.

## Worth knowing

It reads your Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts to build the program list, and
pulls each program's icon. That is all it looks at.

**It makes no network connections at all.** No telemetry, no update check,
nothing phoning home. You can verify that with a firewall, or by reading
`electron/main.js`. Its settings live in `%APPDATA%\Stargate Command`.

## More

[docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) has the long version: how the glyphs were
traced, why the iris is drawn the way it is, how Store apps are launched, and
the Windows gotchas that cost real time.
