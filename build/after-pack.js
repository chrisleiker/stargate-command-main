/*
 * Trim runtime files Electron ships that this app provably never uses.
 *
 * dxcompiler.dll / dxil.dll are the DirectX shader compiler, loaded only when
 * Chromium initializes WebGPU. The gate is drawn entirely with 2D canvas, so
 * that path is never taken — verified by running a packaged build with both
 * removed: the ring renders, a full seven-chevron dial completes, the event
 * horizon paints, and a program launches. Together they are ~26 MB.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT removed, despite being tempting:
 *   vk_swiftshader.dll  the software renderer Chromium falls back to when GPU
 *                       drivers misbehave. Dropping it risks a black window on
 *                       someone else's machine, which is precisely the failure
 *                       you cannot debug remotely.
 *   ffmpeg.dll          media decoding. Our audio is synthesised with
 *                       oscillators, but stripping it is known to destabilise
 *                       some Electron builds for a couple of megabytes.
 *   LICENSES.chromium.html
 *                       large, but it is the copyright notice Chromium's
 *                       license requires be distributed. It also compresses to
 *                       almost nothing in the installer.
 *
 * To keep everything Electron ships, remove "afterPack" from package.json.
